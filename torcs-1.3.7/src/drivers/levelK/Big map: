Big map:
1. [0.9] LevelKDriver.h {have added most necessary member functions, implement getgear()}
2. [0.9] cardata.h .cpp {successfully installed, wait to be implemented in LKD.cpp}
2.5 [0.99] valgrind with TORCS {first installed with debug version configuration, valgrind only helps check memory leak, and torcs runs super slow with valgrind enabled (torcs -g)}
3. [0.9] opponent.h .cpp {successfully installed, wait to be implemented in LKD.cpp}
4. [] LevelKDriver.cpp
generate track
checking after init in drive() in LKD.cpp
add isStuck()

Note: In step 3, I have used forward decleartion to avoid cycle #include between "opponent.h" and "LevelKDriver.h"
