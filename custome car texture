Follow torcs.pdf ch7.3 to learn how to paint your car.

Below are my steps to create custome car textures.
Take level0 cars as example. 
I am using gimp to modify image files.
1. Modify car1-trb1.xcf files in $TORCS_BASE/src/drivers/level0 subfolders (/0,/1,.../9).

2. Save car1-trb1.xcf file as car1-trb1.rgb.

3. modify Makefile in the current directory and subdirectories according to ch7.3 in torcs.pdf or refer to /bt drivers.

4. make build in $TORCS_BASE/src/drivers/level0.

5. You can now play with your new car textures.

NOTE: car1-trb1.xcf and car1-trb1.rgb in $TORCS_BASE/src/drivers/level[0,1,2] are sample texture files. 
NOTE: Don't change filenames of .xcf or .rgb files! Car texture iamge file must match up with car type.
